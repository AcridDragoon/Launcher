# Launcher
A game launcher made in Unity

In its current state the launcher simply launches games according to it's location on my local machine.
This is purely because of convenience and to make a more "one size fits all" type launcher I'm just adding a text boxp to enter the location on your computer
This is in no way seamless or perfect but it is good enough to keep all of my game builds organized.
