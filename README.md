# Launcher
A game launcher made in Unity

In its current state the launcher simply launches games according to it's location on my local machine.
This is purely because of convenience and to make a more 'one single purpose' type launcher
I'm just adding a text box to enter the location of the game on your computer which should technically let it work with any PC?
This is in no way seamless or perfect but it is good enough to keep all of my game builds organized.
I'd suggest using this to manage different versions of the same game so that you can quickly compare differences
